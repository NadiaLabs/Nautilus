You can use Nautilus to generate Markdown documents into one HTML file (including images).

You can see [`docs`](https://github.com/NadiaLabs/Nautilus/tree/master/docs) as a quick example.

### Steps for writing a documents

1. Create a directory for document files.
2. Create a `nautilus.json` file to setup your document configuration.
3. Write your document contents with Markdown format (see [Markdown manual](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and [Markdown Extra manual](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/)).
4. Run the command `php nautilus.phar generate` at your document directory.
